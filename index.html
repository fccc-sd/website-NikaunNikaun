        <h1> About Me</h1>
        <img src="me.jpg" alt="Me, coding this site." height="720" width="893">
        <p> Hi, this is a webpage dedicated to <em>moi</em>, Nick <strong>Fakename</strong>.  I was born in Canada but now live in Ohio with my sister and parents. 
            I also have cerebral palsy, but I don't like to dwell on that too much. If you're wondering what I look like, you might want to see a <em>beautiful</em> photo of me that is on this page. 
            As you can tell by the existence of this page, I enjoy coding and hope to one day direct a game. Admittedly, I have a long way to go.
            Anyway, back to the fun stuff. 
            Some of my favorite things include but are certainly not limited to following items. Allow me to clear my throat. <br> Ahem, here we go: </p>
        <div>
        </div>
        <h2> Things I like</h2>
        <ul>
           <li> My cats. </li>
           <li> Story driven video games. </li>
           <li> MEAT MEAT MEAT.  </li>
           <li> Old rock music. </li>
           <li> Binging wikipedia to learn about random things that would only ever be useful at trivia night. </li>
           <li> Writing poetry and short stories (I have a mostly finished novel, it's bad, i'm too nervous to rewrite it.) </li>
           <li> Things having things they should not have, if you make a piece of media about that you probably already have me sold. Such as: Any small animal having a weapon, an octopus doctor, etc. </li>
           <li> Having really big hair. </li>
           <li> Urban Fantasy </li>
           <li> Soda </li>

        <h2> A Story About Me</h2>
        <p> 
            It was a luscious spring day when my old school was having a spring dance. As an avid introvert, I wasn't having much fun, and it seemed like the DJ knew it. So he graciousy offered me an oppurtunity to 
            man the smoke machine. I did for a bit before heading back to the dance floor before the fire alarm went off. I didn't realize until much later (Actually, i'm lying, I started to realize on the bus home) that it was probably my fault and vowed to take it to the
            grave. Years later, I wrote an essay about it and got a pretty good grade. I sometimes wonder if the DJ realized what happend but didn't rat me out. Does he regret it? I wouldn't blame him, to be honest.

        <h2> About My Cats </h2>
        <p>
            I have three cats and I love them with all my heart. Meshki is a black 10 year old cat and as such has been with me through everything. He was shy most of his life but has become the most generally affectionate
            of them all. He almost never causes trouble and has the cutest little meow. He is the golden child. Gigi is 6 and our only female, she is a diva whose only love is food. As such, her favorite in the 
            family is my dad because he feeds her, though she sometimes cuddles with my sister. Sadly, she is indifferent towards me. She is a highlander. 
            Fettucine is a 1 year old tabby menace with no regard for danger who shares a mutual hatred of Gigi no matter what we try, he sits on my dad's keyboard, goes on the TV to try to touch the celling fan 
            and breaks plates and no matter what, even if we scold him, as long as we touch him he purrs. He also likes being held like he is a human baby being nursed and repeatedly bites random objects,
            dangerous wires, and food. This then caused him to break one of his teeth.
            I don't know what's wrong with him but I love him. I love all three of them.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Stuff I've Made</h2>
       <p> The Night When He Ran: A young mute orphan boy and his excitable friend wake up in a victorian mansion that already has a ragtag group of kids living here who woke up here years ago. Turns out a giant humanoid
        poltergeist is trapping them here and not letting them leave for any reason except hunting and gathering. The mansion also has a door under the stairs that seems to transport them to random places
        frozen in time that give some of the aforementioned kids deja vu, including an empty version of the orphanage our protagonist comes from. How will our cast get out of this? I'm not telling!
        (This is the aforementioned mostly bad novel that I should rewrite that I mentioned earlier.) </p>

        <p> Justice For Ransom: A law school graduate gets kidnapped to be the lawyer for a mob mostly consisting of other kidnapping victims forced to do the dirty work. Meanwhile, his family gets annoynymous tips
        on how to find him. Cue a globetrotting crime drama chasing after a McGuffin the mob boss wants while the victims try to escape. (In early chapters.) </p>
